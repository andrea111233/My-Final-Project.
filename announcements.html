<h1>SDH officers conduct assessment on AUCL</h1><img src="image3.jpg" class="mx-auto d-block" style="width:100%"><p>OFFICERS from the School D’Hospitality Institute (SDH) in Singapore conducted a validation assessment of ANDREA UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LA UNION (AUCL) from May. 2 to 3.

<p>The SDH validators were Academic Development Consultant and senior lecturer Dr. Fred Utanes and Associate Dean Mr. Craig Albrightson. The purpose of the validation program is to ensure that the SDH-trained faculty is providing the highest standards of education.

<p>ANDREA UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LA UNION is in partnership with School D’Hospitality Institute-Singapore since 2017. Programs offered are Diploma in Hotel Operations and Diploma in Business Management for hospitality, tourism and business students.

<p>“We like your students because they are confident, hospitable and articulate,” said Mr. Albrightson when during their lecture and engagement with AUCL's students in the SDH Program.

<p>Dr. Utanes and Mr. Albrightson were also able to introduce SDH Programs to top owners and executives of premier hotels in La Union, in a meeting over coffee initiated by AUCL chief operating officer Mr. Eduardo Arevalo. Among them were La Union Convention Center and Hotel Del Rio chief operating officer Mr. Allan Ryan Tan, Richmonde Hotel La Union resident manager Ms. Natalie Lim, and SEDA Atria hotel manager Mr. Joseph Eduard Del Rosario.

<p>With the future plans for La Union to be known as a MICE destination, the program offerings of SDH are very timely and relevant.  They also talked about industry requirements for its workforce and how the SDH graduates ofAUCL can meet these industry needs.   

<p>With the rigorous training that students experience with SDH, employing future SDH diploma holders from AUCL is something to look forward to by these establishments.  SDH is also open to accepting professionals from the hospitality industry to the program.  This way, their employees will be more competent and globally competitive.

<p>AUCL is a member of the AUCL Education Network, a chain of schools that provides affordable high quality education in the Philippines. Driven by its mission of “Making Lives Better Through Education” AUCL produces competent and employable Filipino professionals who can help build the nation.</p>
