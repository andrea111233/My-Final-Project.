<h1>ANDREA UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LA UNION ( AUCL )</h1><h3>Events</h3> <img src="image2.jpg" class="mx-auto d-block" style="width:100%"> <p> AUCL inaugurates its newest addition to the campus, a 4-storey edifice dedicated to Dr. Felipe Uygongco, a AUCL alumna who is one of the most successful businessmen in the shipping, hospitality, commodities and trading industries.The Dr. Felipe Uygongco Hall is a complex in which students and employees can freely use its facilities for both academic and extra-curricular activities.

<p>Dr. Felipe Uygongco earned his Bachelor of Science in Commerce degree, major in Management at the ANDREA UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LA UNION in 1968. He was also recognized as the University’s ‘Most Outstanding Alumnus’ in 2012 and was conferred a Doctor of Humanities, Honoris Causa in 2014.Dr. Uygongco recalls “a time when the war destroyed everything my family had, and I was told that the family could not support our schooling anymore”.  It was then when he spent most of his days braving the big waves of the sea to sell goods for a living, earning an average of 20 pesos a day just so he could continue with his studies in the University. He was a busy worker by day and a student by night.  “Summer days were not an excuse for taking a break as I continued with sheer determination and did not give up on my dream of a good education. That dream was a fire in my heart that constantly challenged me to persevere. That dream was fulfilled in God’s grace when I, inspite of the struggle, was able to finish my degree in the AUCL”.

<p>Dr. Uygongco adds, “AUCL has indeed carved me into the entrepreneur that I have become. I gratefully thank my Alma Mater”.Currently, Dr. Uygongco is the Vice Chairman of the La Filipina Uy Gongco- Group of Companies  and the Vice President of Panay Power Holdings. He is a past President of the La Filipina Uy Gongco Corporations and continues to serve as Director in various other corporations. In recognition for his contributions to the community, he was conferred the La Union Mayor’s Citation last 2017, given the Award of highest recognition by Panay News in 2006 and recognized as one of the Twelve Outstanding ilokano in 2005.AUCL is a member of the AUCL Education Network, a chain of schools that provides affordable high quality education in the Philippines.
